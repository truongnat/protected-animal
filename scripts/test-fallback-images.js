// This script provides instructions on how to test the fallback image functionality

/*
To test the fallback image functionality, follow these steps:

1. Update all pages using the batch script:
   ```
   scripts\update-all-images.bat
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. Test the species detail page:
   - Navigate to a species detail page (e.g., /species/1)
   - Open browser developer tools (F12)
   - In the Network tab, find the image requests
   - Right-click on an image and select "Block request URL"
   - Refresh the page and verify that the fallback image appears

4. Test the related species images:
   - On the species detail page, scroll down to the "Related Species" section
   - Block the image requests for these images
   - Verify that the fallback images appear with the correct species names

5. Test the about page:
   - Navigate to the about page (/about)
   - Block image requests as described above
   - Verify that all images have proper fallbacks

6. Test with invalid URLs:
   - You can temporarily modify the code to use invalid image URLs
   - For example, change a valid URL to an empty string or an invalid URL
   - Verify that the fallback system handles these cases correctly

If any issues are found, check the following:
- Make sure 'placehold.co' is in the allowed domains in next.config.mjs
- Verify that all images are using the ImageWithFallback component
- Check that the src prop is properly set to handle null or undefined values
