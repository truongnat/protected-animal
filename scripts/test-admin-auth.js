// This script provides instructions on how to test the admin authentication system

/*
To test the admin authentication system, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have set up your environment variables in .env.local:
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

2. Make sure you have created the admin_users table:
   - Run the SQL in scripts/setup-admin-table.sql in the Supabase SQL Editor

3. Create a seed admin user:
   ```
   pnpm seed-admin
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   pnpm dev
   ```

5. Test the authentication flow:
   
   a. Login as the seed admin:
      - Navigate to /admin/auth/login
      - Sign in with admin@example.com and Admin123!
      - You should be redirected to the admin dashboard
   
   b. Test the sign-up flow:
      - Open an incognito window
      - Navigate to /admin/auth/signup
      - Create a new account with your email
      - You should be redirected to the pending approval page
   
   c. Approve the new admin:
      - In your original window (logged in as seed admin)
      - Go to /admin/users
      - Find your new user and click "Approve"
   
   d. Test the approved user:
      - In the incognito window, log out and log back in
      - You should now be able to access the admin dashboard

6. Test the middleware protection:
   - Try accessing /admin/dashboard without being logged in
   - You should be redirected to the login page

7. Test the role-based access:
   - Create another user and leave them in the "pending" state
   - They should only be able to see the pending approval page
