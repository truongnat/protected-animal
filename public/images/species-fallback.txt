This is a placeholder for a fallback image. In a real project, you would place an actual image file here.

For this example, we're using a text file to demonstrate the concept, but in production, you would use:
- species-fallback.jpg
- hero-fallback.jpg
- species-hero-fallback.jpg

These would be actual image files that would serve as fallbacks when the primary images fail to load.
